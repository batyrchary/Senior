This is implementation of raytracer. With help of makefile you can create executable named raytracer. 
Also in inputs.tar.gz there provided simple inputs and expected outputs. Time to generate output will 
depend on how many triangles are there in input.
With command like this "./raytracer ./inputs/scenes/att_test_scene.txt ./inputs/cameras/att_test_camera.txt" you can generate outputs
